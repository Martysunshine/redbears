# 🎯 Zero-to-Hired

## 🚀 Overview

**Zero-to-Hired** is a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge where your mission is to outsmart an AI résumé reviewer! Participants must craft or modify their CVs to exploit a prompt injection vulnerability and convince the system that their résumé is the top choice — using clever strategies, not necessarily real qualifications.

## 🕹️ How It Works

- 🔑 First, get a **free Groq API key** — you’ll need this to run the challenge.  
- 📄 Upload your CV through the interface.  
- 💬 Chat with the AI and **ask it to choose the best CV**.  
- 🧠 If your prompt injection succeeds, the AI will return your CV as the best candidate.
